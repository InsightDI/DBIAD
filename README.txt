INSIGHT DATABRICKS IN A DAY WORKSHOP - README

********************************************************************************

This directory contains the materials for the Insight's current "Databricks in a Day" (DBIAD) workshop.

DBIAD is currently undergoing revisions. We are improving the material, moving around the location of the content, removing the need for a secret key to get the lab files, etc.


TODO

- Create public GitHub location to hold all workshop files. (Chuck) DONE

- Move current workshop files into GitHub, so we start from this point. (Chuck) IN PROCESS

- Make the labs more challenging. Give the students real "problems" that they have to think about and write code. Put the solutions in the notebooks, perhaps in a collapsed cell. (Meagan, Kristina)

- Finish the advanced lab about streaming to an ML job. Put it in a separate notebook, so it is clearly marked and can be included (or not) by the teacher. (Meagan, Kristina)

- Integrate Chuck's intro and wrap-up into the overall PPT and runbook. (Chuck)

- Clean up the runbook, which currently has Chuck's sloppy notes from his recent session. Clean up formatting. (Chuck)

- As much as possible, put everything into Databricks notebooks. So a DBC file contains the morning admin setup, student setup, lecture notes, labs, lab results. Use nice formatting in %md cells for this. (Chuck, Meagan, Kristina)

-- Only exception should be PPT slides that cannot be put into %md. 

-- The class is much easier to run through live if everything is in one place, rather than switching screens back and forth between PPT, Word, instructor Databricks, and student Databricks. 

-- The material will be easier to maintain in one place.
