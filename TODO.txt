DBIAD underwent a significant revision in September 2019. That work is substantially finished. See below.

A remaining task is to do a full, live teach of the new material to work out any kinks. Whoever does this should make sure to put fixes and improvements back into this GitHub repository after the class.


TODO 

- Create public GitHub location to hold all workshop files. DONE

- Move current workshop files into GitHub, so we start from this point. DONE

- Make sure labs can run from any environment -- paid lab provider, or Community Edition, or students' own subscript.  DONE, except where Community Edition does not support a certain feature, such as Jobs.

- Decide about merging the DBC, PPT and Word files into fewer files.  DONE, will eliminated Word and put that info into the notebooks.

- Integrate Chuck's intro and wrap-up into the overall course files (md cells or PPT).  DONE

- Update notebooks, to use local data files from GitHub. DONE

- Merge runbook text into main notebooks.  DONE

- Make the labs more challenging. Give the students real "problems" that they have to think about and write code. Put the solutions in the notebooks, in collapsed cells. DONE

- Review list of labs, to see if we want to add a new topic. DONE, added separate lab about Delta.

- Add real streaming data generation to streaming lab. DEFERRED, might do later.

- Finish the advanced lab about streaming to an ML job. DEFERRED, might do later.
