DBIAD is currently undergoing revisions. We are improving the material, moving around the location of the content, removing the need for a secret key to get the lab files, etc.


TODO (in approx priority order)

- Create public GitHub location to hold all workshop files. (Chuck) DONE

- Move current workshop files into GitHub, so we start from this point. (Chuck) DONE

- Make sure labs can run from any environment -- paid lab provider, or Community Edition, or students' own subscript. Hopefully, this will be possible. (All)

- Decide about merging the DBC, PPT and Word files into fewer files. Will be easier to present and maintain. (Chuck)   DONE. The plan is to eliminate the separate runbook (Word) and put that info into the notebooks.

- Integrate Chuck's intro and wrap-up into the overall course files (md cells or PPT. (Chuck)  DONE

- Port DOCX runbook into temporary notebook markdown cells. (Chuck)   DONE

- Update notebooks, to use data files from GitHub. (Chuck)

- Merge runbook text into main notebooks. Remove temporary runbook notebooks.   (Chuck) 

- Make the labs more challenging. Give the students real "problems" that they have to think about and write code. Put the solutions in the notebooks, in a collapsed cell. (Meagan, Kristina)

- Review list of labs, to see if we want to add a new topic. (All)
-- Consider a lab specifically about Delta. Would need to show something unique about Delta. 

- Improve basic streaming lab, with real streaming data generation. (Meagan)

- Finish the advanced lab about streaming to an ML job. Put it in a separate notebook, so it is clearly marked and can be included (or not) by the teacher. (Meagan)
