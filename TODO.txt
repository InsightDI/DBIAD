DBIAD is currently undergoing revisions. We are improving the material, moving around the location of the content, removing the need for a secret key to get the lab files, etc.


TODO (in approx priority order)

- Create public GitHub location to hold all workshop files. (Chuck) DONE

- Move current workshop files into GitHub, so we start from this point. (Chuck) DONE

- Make sure labs can run from any environment -- paid lab provider, or Community Edition, or students' own subscript. (All)

- Update admin notebook, to reference/mount data from GitHub. (Chuck)

- As much as possible, put everything into Databricks notebooks. So a DBC file contains the morning admin setup, student setup, lecture notes, labs, lab results. Use nice formatting in %md cells for this. (All)
-- The class is much easier to run through live if everything is in one place, rather than switching screens back and forth between PPT, Word, instructor Databricks, and student Databricks. 
-- The material will be easier to maintain in one place.
-- Only exception MIGHT be some PPT slides that cannot be put into %md.
-- Consider content vs code notebooks, so it is easy to find a lecture vs a lab. 

- Integrate Chuck's intro and wrap-up into the overall course files (md cells or PPT. (Chuck)

- Clean up the DOCX runbook, which currently has Chuck's sloppy notes from his recent session. Try to put all of this into md cells in a DB notebook.  (Chuck)

- Make the labs more challenging. Give the students real "problems" that they have to think about and write code. Put the solutions in the notebooks, in a collapsed cell. (Meagan, Kristina)

- Review list of labs, to see if we want to add a new topic. (All)
-- Consider a lab specifically about Delta. Would need to show something unique about Delta. 

- Improve basic streaming lab, with real streaming data generation. (Meagan)

- Finish the advanced lab about streaming to an ML job. Put it in a separate notebook, so it is clearly marked and can be included (or not) by the teacher. (Meagan)
